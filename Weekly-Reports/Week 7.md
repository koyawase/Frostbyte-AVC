###Week 7 Review
* Everyone did their assigned task this week shown by the progress video below of our RPi making its way through the maze.
* No goals set for next week as there is nothing that needs to be done anymore.
* During Week 7 we finished implementing code using both the analog and digital sensor to allow our RPi to navigate its way through the maze by itself.
