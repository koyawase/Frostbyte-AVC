####Week 6 Review
* Everyone did their assigned tasks this week due to the maze being the only thing left to RPi wise.
* We have set goals for next week ([Week 7 Checklist](/Weekly-Reports/Week 7.md)).
* The RPi can navigate partway through the maze for now, it uses a digital senor on the front and an analog sensro angled on one side so it follows one wall through the maze.
* New chassis and wheel have been fitted on and are working well with the code with little tweaks to be made.
