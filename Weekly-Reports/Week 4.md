####Week 4 Review
* Everyone did the tasks they were assigned for this week.
* We have set goals for next week ([Week 5 Checklist](/Weekly-Reports/Week 5.md)).
* Code for opening the gate is still in development, but progress is going well this week.
*The code for following the line currently works fairly well for quadrants 1 -2, with problems occuring in quadrant 3 due to the 90 degree turns present within the demo course. 
* PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) is currently implemented in our RPi with only Kp being used, we have yet to add Kd in.
* We are currently keeping up with the framework of goals we set in our AVC Project Plan with the Rpi being able to complete quadrant 1 and a form of networking communication established.
